The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including noise removal, tokenization, stopword filtering, and transformation using CountVectorizer. After training on over 800,000 complaint records, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of ~78.7%, effectively classifying narratives into product-based categories such as *credit reporting*, *debt collection*, *loan*, and *credit card issues*.\n",
